Zenject: Dependency Injection Framework for Unity3D
=====================================

This project started based on [this](https://github.com/sebas77/Lightweight-IoC-Container-for-Unity3D) implementation. The following articles may be helpful:

http://blog.sebaslab.com/ioc-container-for-unity3d-part-1/

http://blog.sebaslab.com/ioc-container-for-unity3d-part-2/

At some point I will add some more documentation here.  For now, if you are interested in using Zenject, please refer to the included Sample project for intended usage.  For an introduction on Dependency Injection Frameworks in general, I highly recommend Mark Seeman's book, "Dependency Injection in .NET".
